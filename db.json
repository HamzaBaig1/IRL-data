      "body": "Intron reading labs scientists revealed that protein production is directly under the control of DNA resides in nucleus of the cell and it's hard to dictate DNA while proteins produced can easily be engineered compared to DNA which requires more thirty years of advancement in genetic engineering to complete understanding of codons level replacement in whole genome of the most complicated animal (homo S) over the earth.protein assembly of amino acids can lead to codons sequences in genome that's revere genetics but the nest generation medicines will bar upon replacement and insertion of desired sequence of gene"

      "title": "THE URGENCY OF CROSS-BREEDING FOR SPECIES SURVIVAL",
      "body": "Intron reading laboratories scientist revealed the fact that environmental changes espacialy entropy has disturbed the equilibrium of all ecosystems over the earth around the globe, so ultimately heat resistant germ line of DNA of animal species including human life over the earth will survive. Rest all lines of every species will be affected, Severally or may extinct over the earth so its dire demand of the day that cross breeding or cross marriage between cold regions male with hot regions female will give rise to the progeny resistant to heat and finally will survive and this the most cheapest method otherwise human population over the earth may be affected significantly."
